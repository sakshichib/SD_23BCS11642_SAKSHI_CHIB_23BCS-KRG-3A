# URL Shortener

## Description
This project implements a simple URL redirection system that converts long URLs into short URLs and redirects users to the original URL.

## Aim
To design, implement, and evaluate a basic URL shortening service and measure its performance in terms of latency and throughput.

## Objectives
- Understand how URL shortening services work
- Design REST APIs for URL creation and redirection
- Explore short URL generation techniques
- Identify scalability challenges and possible solutions

## Features
- Generate short URLs from long URLs
- Redirect short URLs to original URLs
- Measure response time and request handling capacity

## Tech Stack
- Backend: (e.g., Python / Node.js / Java)
- Framework: (e.g., Flask / Express / Spring Boot)
- Database: (e.g., SQLite / MySQL / MongoDB)

## How It Works
1. User submits a long URL
2. System generates a unique short code
3. Short URL is stored in the database
4. Requests to short URL redirect to original URL
